# OpenCV Tutorial
In this repository I am storing all my practices for working with opencv which I am learning from [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex) and I would try to improvise all the codes and put in my ideas into the project to generate something that matters.

Here are the lesson videos which can be followed:
